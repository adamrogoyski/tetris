# Tetris

Multiple implementations of a simple Tetris game in many languages.

Tetris is simple enough to write in 400-500 lines, yet encompasses many
different elements of a program:

* Graphics
* Sound
* Bitmaps or Textures
* Keyboard input
* Font rendering
* Command-line text output
* Multi-dimensional data structures
* Time and frame handling

The following languages are implemented:

* C (SDL)
* C++ (SDL)
* Go (SDL)
* Perl (SDL, SDLx)
* Python3 (Pygame using SDL)
* Scheme (guile using Chickadee (SDL based))

I intend to write more language implementations.
