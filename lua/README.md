# Lua Tetris

Uses the [lua-sdl2](https://github.com/Tangent128/luasdl2) library. Install with

```
$ luarocks install lua-sdl2
```

Lua style is to use arrays indexed starting by 1 rather than 0. The Tetris
implementation conforms to this style, which is rather different than the other
implementations.
