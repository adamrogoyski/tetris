# Bash Tetris.

A pure bash implementation of Tetris using no shelled-out commands other than stty.

This version has no music, but otherwise functions the same as other implementations.

Assumes these [escape sequences](https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting) and may
not work outside of a typical Linux terminal.
