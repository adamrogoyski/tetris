# Scheme Guile Chickadee Tetris

Runs with the Scheme guile implementation using the
[Chickadee](https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html) game library,
which is based on SDL. Run with "chickadee play tetris.scm" after installing
chickadee and its dependencies.

If you'd like to run and try modifying the code without installing GNU guile
and the Chickadee prerequisites, a bundled version is available for x86 Linux:
